# Human Trafficking Analysis
## Overview
This analysis aims to provide actionable insights into trafficking trends to support decision-makers in targeted prevention and intervention programs.

The dataset is from The Global Synthetic Dataset: [Link](https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/page/global-synthetic-dataset#no-back)

## Data Cleaning/Preparation 
-	Missing values: Assess the importance of the blank value, delete the columns with 100% empty value, delete empty rows, fill the blanks with “Unclassified” or “Unknown” to avoid empty cells and maintain the comprehensive analysis.

-	Data type: Ensure the correct data type for each column for analysis.

-	Transforming data: Add appropriate columns or measures for a smoother analysis.

## Findings
### 1.	Victim Demographic

This dashboard describes the demographic features of human trafficking victims and survivors from 2002 – 2022. 

### Gender
The victims could be any gender, including female, male, transgender or non-conforming. 

However, The Victims by Gender pie chart shows that 60% of victims are women, reinforcing the need to focus on gender-specific vulnerabilities. The assumption is that women are more vulnerable to being trafficked. However, more investigation is needed to determine the cause of this high figure. 

### Age board
People could be trafficked, no matter whether they are adults or minors. 
According to identified records, most victims belong to the working age group. However, the age group with the highest number of victims was the minor group 9 to 17, with 21,049 victims recorded, compared to the highest in adult groups, which is from 30 to 38, with 19,086 victims.

The majority of victims are in the age range of 9 to 38 due to the demand for labour and sexual exploitation. 

Children are vulnerable to human trafficking because they are easily manipulated and can be exploited in all forms. 

### Trend Over Time
The peak victim number was 32,025 in 2016, followed by 29,850 victims in 2019.

### Citizenship 
Besides the unidentified group, the top five countries with the highest victim numbers are Ukraine, the Philippines, America, Moldova, and Mexico. 
This list includes developing and developed countries. Hence, the classification of countries does not affect the victim number.

The prevalence in Ukraine and the Philippines may highlight the role of economic instability, while the USA indicates high reporting or demand.

## 2.	Trafficking Form

### Trafficking Form
People could be trafficked for forced labour, sexual exploitation or both, of which 37% was sexual exploitation and 19% of forced labour, as shown in the Victims by Trafficking Form doughnut chart.

The high proportion (41%) of unclassified trafficking forms highlights data limitations or victims' inability to specify exploitation type.  

### Trafficking Form and Gender
The distributions of victim gender were unequal in each trafficking. Around 86% of sexual exploitation victims were women, whereas there was no significant difference between male and female victims in forced labour form.

Women are vulnerable to all the trafficking forms. This group should be paid more attention.

### Trafficking Form Over Time
The demand for sexual exploitation rose significantly from 2016, doubled the forced labour victim number, and peaked in 2019 with almost tripled. 

### Trafficking Form and Exploitation Country
The Top 5 Hotspots charts show that the USA has the highest reported cases, likely due to better reporting mechanisms or significant exploitation demand. 

## Recommendations
- For policymakers: Invest in educational campaigns for minors (age 9–17) to reduce vulnerabilities.
- For NGOs: Implement gender-focused interventions to support women disproportionately affected by sexual exploitation.
- Researchers: Address data gaps, particularly the "Unclassified" category.
  
## Limitations
This dashboard does not fully explore the dataset. It does not analyse the means that perpetrators used to lure victims and the sectors in which victims were exploited. 

Besides, this report does not contain the perpetrator analysis and the socioeconomic factors that influence human trafficking, such as income, education levels, and unemployment rate, which does not give a comprehensive picture of the situation.
